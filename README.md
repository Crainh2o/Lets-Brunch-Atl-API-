# Lets-Brunch-Atl-API-

This is the back end of my project Lets-Brunch-Atl-API-. My project is about my top three brunch restaurants in Atlanta. Brunch is right after breakfast but before lunch. That's how you have Brunch.
With me being a wife and mom of two, brunch is great way for me to hang out with my friends and be home before the afternoon.

# Hurdles and Problems I had to Overcome

I had to overcome a lot on the back-end. I had to redo my testing because I hard coded what I wanted the test to do. I also had problems with my data loader. Calling the correct methods 
have always been a issue for me. I also had an issue my menu endpoint. I overcame my hurdles by knowledge sharing with my classmates and also looking back through the class documentation. 

# User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a list of brunch restaurants near my location, so that I can decide where to go for brunch.
As a user, I want to be able to search for brunch restaurants based on price range. 
As a user, I want to be able to view detailed information about a specific brunch restaurant, including its menu, opening hours, and customer reviews. 
As a user, I want to be able to leave a review or rating for a brunch restaurant through the API, so that I can share my experience with others.

I chose only three brunch places but the user will be able to choose a brunch place my price, location, and menu. I used google sheets for my planning process. The slide for 
my user stories is below.
